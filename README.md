## Description

This repository contains my personal portfolio. It is a website design that I have built from the ground up to showcase both myself and some of the projects I have worked on. This showcases the skills that I have been working to develop as part of the University of Utah Coding Bootcamp.

Technologies used include React, Express, and Node.
